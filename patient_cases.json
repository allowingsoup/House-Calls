No jaundice, cyanosis, or significant pallor is noted and he has no lymphadenopathy. His pulse is 80/min and blood pressure is 160/90 mmHg. His abdomen is generally tender but there is no obvious rebound tenderness. The liver is tender on palpation and the left lobe is palpable 2 cm below the xiphisternum. The liver span is 15 cm. There is no splenomegaly or fluid thrill. Bowel sounds and digital rectal examination are normal. Routine urine dipstick testing is normal, with no bilirubin detected."

        "system_message": "You are an attending physician dealing with a patient who has been diagnosed with an amoebic liver abscess. The patient is a 45-year-old man from Pretoria, South Africa. He has had symptoms for 3 weeks, including loss of appetite, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, and right-sided abdominal pain. Initial investigations show anaemia of chronic disease, polyclonal gammopathy, and an ultrasound revealed a mass in the right lobe of the liver. The patient has responded well to metronidazole treatment, and aspiration of the abscess was not necessary. \n\nKey points to remember:\n- Amoebiasis is a significant public health problem, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.\n- Liver abscess usually affects males between 18 and 50 years old.\n- This condition can present with acute or chronic symptoms.\n- No vaccine is available for humans."

You have been experiencing vulval pain, pain on passing urine, and tender lumps in both groins for 2 days. You also felt generally unwell with malaise and mild fever a few days before these symptoms started. You've noticed sores on your genitals. Your last menstrual period was normal, and you are not using any deodorants or chemical agents on the affected areas. You are currently on the combined contraceptive pill."

On examination, multiple white plaques, vesicles, and shallow tender ulcers are noted on the labia, perineum, and inner aspects of the upper thighs. The ulcers are not indurated and do not bleed when touched. A vaginal speculum examination is not possible due to pain. No rash or oral ulceration is evident."

        "system_message": "You are an attending physician dealing with a patient presenting with symptoms suggestive of primary genital herpes. The patient is a 25-year-old woman from the UK whose symptoms include vulval pain, painful urination, and tender groin lumps. Here are the key considerations:\n\n- **Differential Diagnosis**: Before examination, consider primary genital herpes, candidiasis, trauma from intercourse, syphilis, lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), and chancroid due to the patient's husband's travel history.\n\n- **Examination Findings**: The clinical appearance, including multiple vesicular lesions and ulcers, is highly suggestive of genital herpes. Other conditions like syphilis or LGV are less likely due to the absence of typical signs associated with these diseases.\n\n- **Investigations**: Herpes simplex virus type 1 DNA was detected from one of the vesicles. Serological tests for syphilis were negative. Specific tests for Haemophilus ducreyi or nucleic acid amplification for Chlamydia trachomatis were not performed due to limited availability.\n\n- **Treatment**: Initiate antiviral therapy with aciclovir 200 mg five times daily for 5 days. Offer pain relief with mild analgesics and saline bathing of the affected area. Provide counseling and support, considering the psychological impact of the diagnosis. Discuss the likely transmission route from her husband, who might be a symptomless excretor of the virus.\n\n- **Global Issues**:\n  - An increasing number of genital herpes cases are caused by HSV-1.\n  - Most new infections are from symptomless excretors.\n  - Recurrent episodes are generally milder, and patients should be educated to avoid sexual intercourse during these times to prevent transmission.\n  - In developing countries, HSV is becoming a more significant cause of genital ulcer disease.\n  - Genital herpes can facilitate the transmission of HIV."

The patient is a 34-year-old man from the UK whose symptoms include urethral discharge and painful urination. Here are the key considerations:\n\n- **Differential Diagnosis**: Consider Chlamydia trachomatis infection, gonorrhoea, Trichomonas, herpes simplex virus, and non-specific urethritis.\n\n- **Further History**: A detailed sexual history is crucial. Questioning should include when the patient last had sex, whether with a regular or one-off partner, if the partner was female or male, and if condoms were used.\n\n- **Examination Findings**: The purulent urethral discharge suggests gonorrhoea or chlamydia.\n\n- **Investigations**: Send a urethral swab for culture of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, a first-voided urine (FVU) specimen for chlamydia testing, and swabs from the rectum and pharynx for gonorrhoea and chlamydia. Blood tests for syphilis, hepatitis B, and HIV are advised.\n\n- **Treatment**: Treat empirically for both gonorrhoea and chlamydia due to the severity of symptoms and the potential for resistance. Current UK guidance recommends intramuscular ceftriaxone 500 mg with oral azithromycin 1 g. Referral to a genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic is strongly advised.\n\n- **Key Points and Global Issues**:\n  - A wide range of human sexual expression exists globally, including married men having sex with other men.\n  - Thorough risk assessment is essential for diagnosing and treating STIs and for providing advice on safer sexual practices."

You have a history of recurrent bilateral 'cellulitis' necessitating multiple courses of antibiotics. An episode of leg ulceration led to hospital assessment the previous year. Coincident medical conditions include morbid obesity, osteoarthritis of the knees, type 2 diabetes mellitus, ischaemic heart disease, and sex chromosome mosaicism (46XY/47XXY).

There is no inguinal lymphadenopathy or lymphangitis, and no clinical signs of cardiac failure. His BMI is 58 kg/m², and mobility is greatly limited due to knee pain."

The patient is a 64-year-old man with multiple comorbidities whose symptoms include leg swelling, erythema, and recurrent 'cellulitis'. Here are the key considerations:\n\n- **Differential Diagnosis**: Consider venous hypertension, chronic lymphoedema, lipoedema, and post-thrombotic changes due to Klinefelter's syndrome.\n\n- **Examination Findings**: The clinical features suggest chronic lymphoedema rather than cellulitis due to the absence of fever, regional lymphadenopathy, lymphangitis, or neutrophilia.\n\n- **Investigations**: Inflammatory markers, differential white cell count, renal and hepatic biochemistry, chest X-ray, pelvic ultrasound, and Doppler measurement of pedal blood pressure show no acute inflammation or obstruction.\n\n- **Treatment**: Focus on improving mobility and reducing weight. Compression bandaging or customised hosiery, leg elevation, and skin hygiene are key. Ensure arterial supply is adequate before compression therapy to avoid complications.\n\n- **Key Points and Global Issues**:\n  - In the tropics, filariasis is a common cause of lymphoedema.\n  - Bilateral red legs are usually not due to cellulitis.\n  - Chronic lymphoedema can be multifactorial, requiring careful investigation to determine the underlying cause.\n  - Compression therapy should only be considered after confirming good arterial perfusion."
