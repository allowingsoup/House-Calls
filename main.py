    - **Select a Case**: Navigate to the 'Select Case' page to choose or randomly select a medical case to simulate.
    - **Interact with the Patient**: On the 'Patient' page, you can gather patient history as if you were conducting an actual consultation.
    - **Perform Physical Exam & Diagnostics**: Here, you'll receive objective information on physical examination findings, lab results, and imaging. Use this to make differential diagnoses.
    - **Consult with the Attending Physician**: Get guidance, suggest appropriate investigations, and discuss potential diagnoses and treatments with an experienced physician simulation.
    - **Start a New Case**: Use the 'New Case' button in the sidebar to reset the simulation for a fresh start.
    
    After going through a case, you can choose another or select a random one for more practice. Your goal is to diagnose the patient by synthesizing the information provided through each interaction.
